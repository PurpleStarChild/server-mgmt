This is a repository that I use for orchestrating and centrally updating the projects I help maintain. Right now it is broken into two pieces:
1. ext_sites - This is all websites/services/etc that aren't part of the core infrastructure. This includes personal blogs, outside group forums, etc. 
2. infra - This repository is for managing the core wayreth infrastructure.
